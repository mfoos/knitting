I like knitting because it’s structured. Following the pattern results in the expected item, but there is also the creativity of choosing colors, or electing to modify a pattern. In either case, you end up with a useful, beautiful product that reflects your work and that you can take pride in. In fact, I think knitting has a lot in common with computer programming.

* Most obvious to the uninitiated, you can choose how to process your array elements. When you knit something flat, like a scarf, you knit into your most recent stitch to start the next row (LIFO). When you knit something “in the round”, like a hat or any tube, you’re actually making a spiral, and thus knit the first stitch of your new pseudo-row only after having gone completely around (FIFO).

* My favorite example comes from my experience with stranded knitting, a technique where the yarn is frequently swapped out to create a colorful pattern on the “right side”, creating a huge tangle in the process. The books all tell you that if you do it right, it should look just as neat on the “wrong side”. In programming, you’re taught to encapsulate functions to keep things neat and readable. In both cases, you quickly learn that you can make it “work” without the housekeeping. Then you realize that you’ve just shot yourself in the foot, and that these guidelines exist for a reason. In programming as in knitting, you will never regret having things look nice under the hood.

* There is also a similarity between software packages and the modularity of knitted construction. When programming, you often identify a problem solution that has already been coded up by someone else (as in an R package) and save yourself some time by using it. In knitting, you can also make a sweater entirely from pieces of patterns other people already worked the bugs out of. 

* I insist that knitting patterns are a great object example. The pattern itself defines the class, and each hat or scarf or sweater made from that pattern in an instance. They have attributes like color and size that differ from instance to instance. They even inherit from other classes – an earflap hat inherits its closed top and open bottom from class hat!
